# FileFinder-2.0
A fast and reliable file/folder search tool made in C# (WPF). 

It's essentialy a rewrite of my python version of the app. Since it is written in C#, it's very lightweight (You only need the executable which is 237 KB).
Also it's really fast compared to the python version. Furthermore, I removed some weird settings that only cluttered the app.

Complete visual overhaul - it doesn't look like a piece of junk anymore (at least I hope so ;)).

All the project files are provided so if you want to look at the code.. maybe improve it, you're free to.

However to use the app, you only need to download and unpack the zip folder!

I hope the app will prove to be useful to somebody, cheers!
