# FileFinder-2.0
A fast and reliable file/folder search tool (GUI) made in C# (WPF). 

It's essentialy a rewrite of my python version of the app. Since it is written in C#, it's very lightweight (You only need the executable which is 237 KB).
Also it's really fast compared to the python version. I also removed some weird settings that only cluttered the app.
Complete visual overhaul - it doesn't look like a piece of junk anymore (at least I hope ;)).

All the project files are provided so if you want to look at the code.. maybe improve it, you're free to, just submit a fork request.
However to use the app, you only need the raw executable.

I hope the app will prove to be useful to somebody, cheers!
